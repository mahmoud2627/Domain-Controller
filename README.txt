Domain Controller For educational organizations and Their Branches :

üîç Project Overview:
- Web Servers: We set up two web servers (http://www.web1.com and https://www.web2.com) to handle different tasks and tested their accessibility.
- Domain Controllers: Configured DC1 within the ITI.LOCAL domain and established a child domain, Alex.ITI.LOCAL.
- DNS Configuration: Implemented DNS to ensure proper resolution and accessibility of our web servers.
- Network Setup: Connected multiple PCs (PC1, PC2, PC3, PC4) and configured them with specific permissions and roles.
- RODIC: Implemented RODIC (Read-Only Domain Controller) to enhance security and manageability within the network.

üë• Key User Configurations:
- USR1@ITI.LOCAL: Restricted from logging into PC1 on Fridays.
